# Predictive-Analysis-in-Breast-Cancer-Malignancy-Classification
The final project of the Introduction to Data Science course focused on classifying breast cancer malignancy using machine learning algorithms. The project aimed to evaluate the performance of several models in classifying malignancy based on medical test data from 569 patients. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/data) and included 32 variables representing various diagnostic features.

We conducted data preprocessing by removing irrelevant variables and handling missing values, followed by feature selection using the Random Forest method, which identified four key features: radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, and area_mean. We then applied and compared four classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The data were split into training and testing sets (70:30), and model performance was evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.

Among the models, the Decision Tree algorithm achieved the highest test accuracy at 99.42%, making it the most effective classifier in this study. This project provided hands-on experience in the end-to-end data science workflow, including preprocessing, feature engineering, algorithm implementation, and evaluation. It also reinforced my understanding of predictive analytics in healthcare and the importance of using interpretable models to support clinical decision-making.
